# TextbookManagement
During my senior year of high-school, my team was tasked with developing a textbook management system. We ended up winning an award for this project. My high-school utilizes this system to assign students textbooks.

To run the program, download all the files and put them in a folder. Once that is done, open the .bat file to run the program.
